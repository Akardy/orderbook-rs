### Rust OrderBook Engine

This project is a simple orderbook engine implemented in Rust, designed to simulate the core functionality of a cryptocurrency exchange. It allows users to place market and limit orders, view the order book, and cancel orders.

## Features

- **Orderbook Engine**: Supports both bid (buy) and ask (sell) orders.
- **Matching Engine**: Implements a matching engine that automatically matches incoming limit orders against existing orders on the opposite side of the book.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Provides a simple CLI for interacting with the orderbook, placing orders, canceling orders, and viewing the current state of the orderbook.

## Upcoming Features

- **User Accounts**: The ability for users to create accounts loaded with fake credits, place orders, and trade with their balance.
